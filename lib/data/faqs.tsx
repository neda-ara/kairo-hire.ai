    question: "What actually happens during an AI mock interview?",
    answer:
      "Once you choose a role or industry, KairoHire’s AI engine generates realistic interview questions tailored to that job type. You respond in real-time (via text or voice), and the AI analyzes your answers for structure, clarity, tone, confidence, and relevance to the role. Then, it gives you personalized, constructive feedback: what went well, what could be improved, and how to frame your answers more effectively. Think of it as practicing with a smart coach that never tires — you can repeat sessions, track your progress, and build your confidence before you ever step into a real interview.",
